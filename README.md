# Welcome to my visualization repository for the international coffee organization: 
a project in which I visualize the international coffee crisis: so-named because the revenue produced by coffee doesn't reach the growers in sufficient quantity and with sufficient constraints to both avoid overproduction and ensure quality.

Here you will find the transformed data I used to create my Tableau dashboard, along with, as I create it, the code to perform said transformations.

# Instructions

To follow along, one could download the data from the International Coffee Organization here: https://www.ico.org/new_historical.asp. The freely available data is from 1990 to the present. 

I transformed this data by hand because in the context of this project, I Python/Pandas was not an available option. Sometime soon I can add a python notebook that produces usable .csv files. For now I have uploaded my handmade .csv files here.

The .csv files represent cleaned and pivoted versions of the data included in the eponymous .xlsx files available for download.

These are then uploaded into my public Tableau account which is visible here:
